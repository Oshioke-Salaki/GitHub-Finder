# GitHub Finder

This is a simple project a did a while back that felt the sudden need to push to Github :). I built this using vanilla Javascript and bootstrap. Also used the github api to get my external data.

# How it works

You just type in the input feild and then the application looks for a the user you typed in using the github api. If the user is found, their profile is displayed.
